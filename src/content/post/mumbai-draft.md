Living in a Capsule like Hostel in Mumbai. 

Mostly Indians. You don't see a lot of turists.
Arrived at November. The weather is good, a bit hot.
International cards doesn't works. A lot of applications requires indian number. A work around for delivery Swiggy is by purchasing a virtual temp number. I used sms-man. IndiGo send OTP doesn't work. International card doesn't work means Uber doesn't work. Public transport are not quite good to use because of long queue and too many poeple pushing making carrying luggage hard. Pollution is a big issue, walking on the street makes you cough and sneeze. random Indian may reach to you and ask you questions like where you come from or what are you doing here.
