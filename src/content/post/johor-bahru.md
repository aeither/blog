# Johor Bahru
R&F Princess Cove target cross border workers. 
I feel the JB Sentral prices are expensive on Malaysia standard. This area is area is more expensive due to people with more expending power from Singapore. The prices probably is going to keep at this point between Malaysia local cheap and Singapore expensive.

Building RTS Link directly to Woodland - Singapore. Expected to be finished by 2026



## More
JB Sentral is very westernized
Franchisings: KFC, Burger's King, Subway
