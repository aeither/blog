TRUE At 711 200 bhat, 30GB, 30 days

## Neighborhoods
Favourite areas
- Pathum Wan: Shopping centers.  It is my personal centre of the city. It has the highest concentration of mall and space for events, conferences. Silom and Sukhumvit or green line that are well connect with other lines.
- Wang Mai: Street Food, Chulalongkorn University Centenary Park, Backpacker Hostels
- Chom Phon and Chatuchak: Close to Bus Station, Big Park, Weekend market, Malls, Street food/Restaurants, Hotels

Others
- Sukhumvit road in Khlong Toei: Night life and tourists.
- Silom: Financial district, Lumpini Park.
- Chinatown: Food area. Personally I think it is over promoted. 
- Riverside: Good View. There is a market and attractions. Attractions are Tourist trap but it worth a visit for sight-seeing.
- Khao San: Promoted as for cheap, Backpacker friendly. Never been there.
