## Saigon impressions
Entering airport was a struggle. long queue. Asked a lot of questions.

Walking around the city's a breeze, but keep an eye out for fast motorbikes, especially in tight spots. Everything's close by, with lots of stores open all the time. February nights feel great, not sticky like in Malaysia. Traffic can be annoying, and there's no subway like in other big places. tons of vegetarian options. The mood's laid-back, with people enjoying themselves, hanging out, and singing during meals.

Banh Mi is the most common street stands food. with pate and meat floss. mixed meat consist of a lot of processed meat.
Main dishes most common meat is pork.
Metro should be available for next year.

ATM withdraw is a headache. There is fee for withdrawing. Not very transparent. The machine doesn't show beforehand how much is charging

There are balloons of nitrous oxide in nightlife. also known as laughing gas. it can cause oxygen deprivation

There are girls who brings you to their bar and they gets a cut

the stores closes early

wet towel cost money.

Local chains: 
- Katinat Tea & Coffee: opened in 2016. More than 30. Mainly in Saigon
- Phúc Long (prosperous dragon) Coffee Shop in Saigon

locals use Zalo for messagging and ZaloPay for payments

tv programs: a lot of chinese programs may that is why viet people wants to learn chinese after english. there are western sport program.

Vietnam is also a cat country. people have cats. there are cats on the street
